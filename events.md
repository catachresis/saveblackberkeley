## Sunday, August 14: Summer BBQ at Uncle Ernest's House

Join us this *Sunday 8/14 from 1pm to 4pm*, to honor the life and legacy of Uncle Ernest Thorton, former homeowner of 835 Page Street in Berkeley--as well as countless other families who are experiencing the loss of their homes--by attending our summer BBQ at 835 Page Street in Berkeley. There will be FREE FOOD, MUSIC, and stuff for the kids to do!

We need your support in stopping the sale of this home and preserving it for Uncle Ernestâ€™s family. Help us fight back!
